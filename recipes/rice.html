    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rice is a common staple of diets in most households. It requires very little ingredients apart from itself and is incredibly flexible. 
        It can be combined with an endless number of dishes.</p>
    <p>The key to cooking good rice is timing. All you really need is a pot and some water, no need for a fancy rice cooker or special ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of white rice, like Basmati</li>
        <li>A splash of olive oil</li>
        <li>25g of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>(Optional) 1/2 cup of corn kernels</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat up your stainless steel pot, adding a layer of olive oil and the butter</li>
        <li>Once the butter is melted, add your rice</li>
        <li>Proceed to stir your rice in the oil and butter mixture until the rice starts to brown</li>
        <li>Add your water, generally 1.5:1 water to rice ratio and put the lid on the pot</li>
        <li>(Optional) Add your corn to the rice</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil then turn the heat down to low</li>
        <li>Once the rice has absorbed the water and you can't see any bubbles, turn the heat off and cover the lid with a kitchen towel</li>
        <li>Let the rice sit for 10 minutes before serving</li>
    </ol>
